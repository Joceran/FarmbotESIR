# A heap-ish data structure required when converting canonical CeleryScript AST
# nodes into the Flat IR form.
# This data structure is useful because it addresses each node in the
# CeleryScript tree via a unique numerical index, rather than using mutable
# references.

  # Supporting class for CSHeap (below this class)
  # PROBLEM:  CSHeap uses numbers to address sibling/parent nodes.
  # PROBLEM:  Numbers are very easy to mix up. Is it an array index? A SQL
  #           primary key? A primitive value? It's not always easy to say.
  # SOLUTION: Create a `HeapAddress` value type to remove ambiguity.
  #           Prevents confusion between index IDs and SQL IDs.
