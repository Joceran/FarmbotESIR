      # Originally, `args` and `body` were optional. We stored them in a
      args # serialized column and it was very inexpensive to retrieve them
      body # from the database. Serialized columns led to an enormous amount of
      # issues in other parts of the app, however. One of the tradeoffs that we
      # now face is that we can no longer call `sequence.args` and
      # `sequence.body` as quickly as in the old days. It also means these
      # fields are now mandatory for sequence updates.
      #
      # In the long term, the app benefits from the new storage mechanism
      # because it is easier to track sequence dependencies, migrate deprecated
      # sequences, and also to query for data inside of a sequence (nearly
      # impossible under the old database schema.
